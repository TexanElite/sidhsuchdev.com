            <h1>Moving to Hong Kong from the US</h1>
        </header>
        <p>I am moving to Hong Kong from the US for personal and work reasons. I will likely move around September 2025, and will most likely be difficult for me to adjust. There are many hurdles that I will face while moving:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I do not speak Cantonese</li>
            <li>I am not literate in any form of written Chinese</li>
            <li>I have never lived outside of the US</li>
            <li>I do not know laws that differ from Hong Kong and the US</li>
            <li>I do not understand US tax policy for expats in Hong Kong</li>
            <li>I am vegan and want to maintain this diet despite the general cuisine norms</li>
            <li>HKG to JFK is a 16 hour flight, so trips back to the US will be infrequent</li>
            <li>I have almost no friends who live or are planning to live in Hong Kong</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is abundantly clear that I should prepare for these difficulties ahead of time in order to mitigate the shock. This page will be updated on actions I am taking to ensure I am prepared for the move.</p>
